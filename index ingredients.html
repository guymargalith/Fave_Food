        <p>Falafel is a traditional Middle Eastern food, commonly served in a pita, which acts as a pocket, or wrapped in a flatbread known as taboon; "falafel" also frequently refers to a wrapped sandwich that is prepared in this way. The falafel balls are topped with salads, pickled vegetables, hot sauce, and drizzled with tahini-based sauces. Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a snack or served as part of a meze tray (assortment of appetizers).</p>
        <p>While the exact origins of falafel are unknown, there are many popular theories. Most of these theories agree that falafel was developed in Egypt. However, the subject of when and by whom is rather contested. Some maintain that it dates back about 1,000 years to the Egyptian Copts, who brought it with them from the Middle East. Others say that falafel can from India in the 6th century.

            One of the more accepted theories places the invention of falafel in more modern times, in the late 19th century. This is about the time when the dish started appearing in Egyptian literature, right after the British occupation in 1882. According to this theory, British officers enjoyed fried vegetable croquettes when they were in India and asked their Egyptian cooks to prepare a version with local ingredients.
            
            It is believed that falafel first emerged in Alexandria, the principal port of Egypt and the city with the largest concentration of European troops. Unlike many of the popular versions served in todayâ€™s falafel restaurants, this first falafel was made with fava beans. As the name for fava beans in Egyptian is ful, it is believed that the word falafel comes from these original Mediterranean recipes.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Methodology</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cook's Tip: You will need to start with dried chickpeas, pls do not used canned chickpeas here, it is insulting. You will need to begin by soaking the chickpeas overnight, ideally 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Falafel Recipe Variations: Variations of this recipe may call for flour or eggs. If you prefer, you can add 1 to 1.5 tablespoons of flour to the falafel mix or 1 egg. This recipe doesn't call for either and does a pretty good job of holding together.</li>
            <li>Pro Tip for Frying: When you fry the falafel patties, you want to achieve a deep golden brown color on the outside. More importantly, the patties need to be fully done on the inside. Your frying oil needs to be at 375 degrees F, for my stove, that was at a medium-high temp. Be sure to test your first batch and adjust the frying time as needed.</li>
            <li>Popular Falafel Sauce: tahini sauce is what is traditionally used with falafel. I use organic tahini paste by Soom, and here is my tahini sauce recipe.</li>
            <li>Baked Falafel Option: If you prefer, you can bake the falafel patties in a 350 degree F heated oven for about 15-20 minutes, turning them over midway through. Use a lightly oiled sheet pan, and you might like to give the patties a quick brush of extra virgin olive oil before baking.</li>
            <li>Pro-Tip for Make-Ahead: To make ahead and freeze, prepare the falafel mixture and divide into patties (up to step #6). Place the patties on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and freeze. When they harden, you can transfer the falafel patties into a freezer bag. They will keep well in the freezer for a month or so. You can fry or bake them from frozen.</li>
